<!--
Description of AAA

Intro:
General introduction
Previous presentation about DASK
Description of the problem, going from SAS to F#.
SAS only has globals and macros => house of cards ready to tumble

Debugging made easy with the REPL. Being able to load up a single policy and call library functions on it. Mention deedle frames.

Result type - Railway oriented programming

Immutability is king

Beware of easy string translations

Performance in general.
GC stats, being allocation bound because of immutability

Testing. Mostly doing a full test. Good unit tests hard to implement for many business rules.
