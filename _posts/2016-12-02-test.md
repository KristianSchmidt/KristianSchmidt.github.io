This post is part of the [F# Advent Calendar 2016](https://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/2016/10/23/f-advent-calendar-in-english-2016/). Check it out for two F# blog posts a day for the whole month of December. And special thanks to [Sergey Tihon](https://twitter.com/sergey_tihon) for organizing this!

What the most efficient way to get the F# community into the christmas spirit? Someone using F# in production, surely.
So today I'm going to give a little intro to our latest project, and reflect a bit on the challenges we faced.

## Liar's dice

<!--
Description of AAA

Intro:
General introduction
Previous presentation about DASK
Description of the problem, going from SAS to F#.
SAS only has globals and macros => house of cards ready to tumble

Debugging made easy with the REPL. Being able to load up a single policy and call library functions on it. Mention deedle frames.

Result type - Railway oriented programming

Immutability is king

Beware of easy string translations

Performance in general.
GC stats, being allocation bound because of immutability

Testing. Mostly doing a full test. Good unit tests hard to implement for many business rules.
