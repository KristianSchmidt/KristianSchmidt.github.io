title: Slides From My Talk At MF#K   
---
Yesterday I presented a talk at the functional programming Copenhagen meetup. It was about our use of F# in the actuarial team at PFA Pension, where I gave some examples of neat use cases and our general experience using the language.

It gave me a chance to use [FsReveal](http://fsprojects.github.io/FsReveal/) for the first time, and I must say I was pretty impressed. The integration with Paket, FAKE and Suave makes everything run smoothly, and just writing your slides in markdown is so much easier than messing around in PowerPoint.

I've converted the slides to PDF and made them available for download here: [Slides](http://kreutz.us/Slides/MFK%20Jan%202016/FSharp%20at%20PFA%20Pension.pdf)

One thing I actually forgot to mention is that we use both Paket and FAKE to make dependency management and our builds much easier to deal with.
